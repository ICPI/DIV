## Logo choices

### Original
Our original logo is getting a little dated and with our new ICPI strategy and rebranded datasets, its time we revisit our logo.

### Proposed Logos
The new proposed logo was inspired by the RStudio Tidyverse package logos/stickers.

I [laid out four logo choices](https://github.com/icpi-div/org/issues/29#issuecomment-363910124) to the DIV, all variants of the same core hex label (the original versions had a thicker border)

Memembers were in favor of version 2, that brings in a larger PEPFAR ribbon.

While I think it prudent to keep the logo minimal and clean, I put together some options incorporting our name, which I think makes it a bit clunky. If we do need to include a version with text, we believe version 2a would be the best of these, but our recommendation would be to exlude it.

I have also juxiposed the PEPFAR logo with the proposed logo to see how the two work together. I think it provides a nice contrast.
