## Standard File Name Structure and Components

File naming may vary slightly based on the file type (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.), but will generally maintain the below structure. The differences are noted below and in Table 1.

**TitleOfDocument**__DocType_OU_**_FYXXQX***_**YYYYMMDD**_Version_initials_

**Bold = required for all tools**

_Italics = only use this component where applicable_

**Title of Document** 

- What is this? 
- Is this for a specific Cluster or topic area? 
- Examples: OVC, PPR, Datapack

_DocType_
- Use this component only when the Title of the Document is not sufficient to explain the file 
- Is this QC of a tool? 
- Is it a dashboard/tool? 
- Examples: QC, Dashboard, Dataset

_OU_

- Use this component only when applicable. 
- If this file that contains information only for a one OU, this is where to write it in the filename
- If this file is a global tool, then you may put global or leave this field empty
- Examples: Tanzania, Global, CentralAmericanRegion,

**FYXXQX***

- When a file contains a dataset, this field is required. This field is also required with QC instructions with datasets.
- The asterisk (*) indicates that this space after the Quarter should be used to indicate whether the dataset used in a file is from an initial data release or a cleaned data release. 
     - Use lowercase “i” to indicate an initial data release
     - Use lowercase “c” to indicate a cleaned data release
- The Fiscal Year and Quarter may not be applicable in all cases, such as a general background to a topic, guides to updating tools, etc.
- Examples: FY18Q1i, FY18Q1c, FY17APRi, FY17APRc

**YYYYMMDD**

- Required of all files
- This is should be the most recent for which changes were made to a file
- Include “0” in front of the month and date if it is a single digit
- Examples: 20180124, 20180721

_Version:_
•	Used for internal communications within a team 
•	Examples: v1, v2, v3

_Initials:_ 
•	Used for internal communications within a team 
•	Examples: _en, _ks, _ac

### Best practices

- Strike a balance between keeping the name short, but yet meaningful.
    - Short, as long names do not work well with certain software.
    - Meaningful, so one can identify the general contents of the file.
- Abbreviate wherever possible.
- Do not leave spaces, but use ‘underscore’ (_) or camel case instead. This makes it easier to parse through software scripts. 
- Do not use special characters such as ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ` ; < > ? , [ ] { } ' " and | 
- Do not use quotes of any kind, single of double.
