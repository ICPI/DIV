# Tableau power-users meeting 3/15/2018

Attendees: Kristy, Kashmira, Kimi, Katya 

### Discussion
- Logistics - users to borrow laptops for those who do not have Tableau Desktop installed

- Communication: Email reminders to registered participants on June 11 and June 18

   - Please watch the 20minute getting started video before the training. It is expected that you come to the training knowing how to open Tableau. Pre-work will help you get acquainted with Tableau functionality and highly recommended that you complete it. This will be a short exercise in building a basic bar graph using a publicly available dataset. Office hour(s) can be held on a Tuesday/Thursday for one hour each the week of July 11th for those that want to complete the task in a group setting or ask questions. 
   - Tableau Desktop - please make sure you can open Tableau Desktop on the laptop you will be using when you attend the training. If you plan to use a trial version of Tableau Desktop, please make sure that this will not expire before the June 21st training. If you do not have Tableau Desktop and won't have it in time for the training, please let us know by June 18th so we can identify loaner laptops. 
   
- Next steps tracked in issues
