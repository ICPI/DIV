## FY2018 DIV ACCOMPLISHMENTS

### BACKGROUND
Almost a year ago, the ICPI saw a gap around visualization needs and the need to work with Panorama and as a result stood up the Data Integration and Visualization (DIV) Cluster under the Coordinating Team. The DIV supports ICPI and PEPFAR through promoting innovative analyses and visualizations, with a particular responsibility of coordinating and developing best practices for data integration and visualization.

### STRUCTURE
To accomplish this task, the DIV is divided into two teams, Business Intelligence System Coordination (BI) and Guidance and Capacity Building (GCB). The work of BI centers around setting requirements for visualizations and back-end data needs in PEPFAR Panorama as well as running data quality checks to ensure users are accessing the correct data. GCB's vision is to improve workflows, analyses, and visualizations produced by ICPI staff.

### ACCOMPLISHMENTS

#### Guidance and Capacity Building
It's been a busy year for the GCB, standing up the team and providing guidance and capacity building to ICPI analysts in a number of ways across ICPI.

- **Best Practices Documentation**: To help create cohesion around standard practices, the DIV produced a number of products around best practices. One of the first products provided guidance around **[file naming conventions](https://github.com/ICPI/DIV/blob/master/Best_Practices/Best%20Practices%20-%20NamingConventions.md)** so that it would be clear for all ICPI files, both internal as well as those that are disseminated, what the file contains, what operating units it relates to, and which MSD it was built off of. Regarding the MSD, the DIV, in collaboration with the Data, Access, and Quality (DAQ) Cluster produced **guidance for setting up pivot tables** with our PEPFAR data. Lastly, the GCB **promoted ICPI's adoption of GitHub** as a platform for both sharing code used in analysis and tool production as well as for program management. Best practices around **[using GitHub](https://github.com/ICPI/DIV/blob/master/Best_Practices/Best%20Practices%20-%20GitHub.md)** and **[creating repositories in GitHub](https://github.com/ICPI/DIV/blob/master/Best_Practices/Best%20Practices%20-%20GitHub%20Repos.md)**. Moving away from our own created content, we also host a **[resources wiki](https://github.com/ICPI/DIV/wiki/Resources)** which consolidates a lot of great guidance around data visualation, Excel, R, and GitHub.
- **Style Guidance**: While producing a full style guidance is still a work in progress, the GCB has developed a few of the initial pieces in the process. The intent here is that all ICPI products would have a similar look and feel to them. One critical that helped with the rebranding of our products and ICPI in general involved the development of a **[new logo](https://github.com/ICPI/DIV/blob/master/ICPI_Logo/ICPI_logo.png)**. Regarding more of the ICPI products, we created a number of **[ICPI color palettes](https://github.com/ICPI/DIV/blob/master/Color_Palettes/ICPI_Color_Palette.pdf)** to create uniformity across our products. The team also created a **[vlog on the ICPI color palettes](https://pepfar.adobeconnect.com/pxidn6wc81z8/)**.   
- **Workshops**: The GCB has put on a number of workshops or brownbags in the past year. We have hosted a participatory session on **structuring the back-end of Excel our tools**. To promote best practices with GitHub, we have put on two trainings on **[GitHub for project management](https://github.com/ICPI/DIV/blob/master/Presentations/GitHub%20Workshops/GitHub%20for%20Project%20Management.pptx)** and **[GitHub for data science](https://github.com/ICPI/DIV/blob/master/Presentations/GitHub%20Workshops/GitHub%20Workshop%2020180809.pdf)**. The team also put on two "Show and Tell" workshops, going into the **[benefits of tool automation](https://github.com/ICPI/DIV/tree/master/Presentations/Tool%20Building%20Automation)** as well as on **[how to take advantage of custom made functions and packages](https://github.com/ICPI/DIV/tree/master/Presentations/ICPIutilties)** by using the [`ICPIutilities` package](https://github.com/ICPI/ICPIutilities/blob/master/README.md) in R.
- **Trainings**: In addition to a number of shorter workshops, the GCB heavily contributed to the coordination and production of a couple of multi-day trainings. The GCB produced a well received **[Tableau training](https://github.com/ICPI/tableau_training)** and a [50 page training document](https://github.com/ICPI/tableau_training/blob/master/Training%20materials/ICPI%20Tableau%20Training%20Handouts.pdf) to accompany it. The GCB also produced two of a four part **[R training](https://github.com/ICPI/R-Training)** for both ICPI analysts and headquarter users. In addition to the great trainings the team developed, we also created a **[training dataset](https://github.com/ICPI/TrainingDataset/tree/master/Output)**, which masks the PSNU and IM data pulled at random from the MSD, to be used in both trainings as a manageable-sized and anonymous dataset as well as for public or demonstration materials.
