# ICPI Platform Guidance 2019

A list of free tools that have federal-compatible terms of service agreements is available on [digital.gov](https://digital.gov/resources/negotiated-terms-of-service-agreements/#).
The federal government doesnâ€™t endorse, sponsor or recommend the products or services on this site or consider them to be superior to any other products or services.

ICPI is an inter-agency space for data analytics and as such requires the use of communication tools across agencies. This guidance is to serve as a starting point for engaging with staff through various platforms.
If you are a new member of ICPI, please ensure you are signed up for these platforms during your onboarding.

## Data & Privacy
As this is a public space, it is important to protect the data associated with countries and people receiving PEPFAR support. Please do not post sensitive information about PEPFAR programs, funding, etc. You may post items on pepfar.net and then include the link either in Slack or GitHub. 

*When I should provide a link to pepfar.net instead of posting the direct info?*
- Images display data that can be linked to a partner, IM, agency, country, etc. 
- Any data/info can be linked to a site or geographically identify vulnerable groups
- Funding data linked to partner, IM, agency, country, etc.

## Slack
Slack is a team communication platform where teams can create channels to discuss various topics and projects. Because it is a web-based platform, any agency should be able to login and access it. This allows for quick communication across agencies since there are differences in messaging platforms across agencies. Please familiarize yourself with Slack by viewing the ICPI [vlog](https://pepfar.adobeconnect.com/p5ukcjq44hy4/). 

## GitHub
GitHub is a collaborative software development tool	and available for creating projects and storing code. Please review the [GitHub workshop materials](https://github.com/ICPI/DIV/tree/master/Presentations/GitHub%20Workshops) and [vlog](https://pepfar.adobeconnect.com/pdoe0ona1a8k/) to familiarize yourself with GitHub for ICPI. 

## Agency-specific
Please follow the instructions of your agency for use of email and messaging platforms.
