# Data Integration and Visualization (DIV) Subcommittee - Proposed Scope of Work

1. Continue to translate routine MER, EA and SIMs tools in to existing PEPFAR BI tool (i.e., Panorama)
PRIME/ICPI Bridge Meeting: Bi-weekly Panorama meetings and quarterly priority-setting meetings
   1. Communicate directly with PRIME on visuals for Panorama (invited to PRIME Panorama meetings when needed)  
   2.	Prioritize and rank tools and visuals for integration  
   3.	Set requirements for tools to be integrated
   
2. Continue to work on and expand the role of the analytic workspaces in Microstrategy, and support the development of analytic workspaces that match the needs of country teams
   1.	Short-term: Lead Phase II Pilot of Analytic Work Spaces (through end of August)  
   2.	Medium-term: Provide feedback into discussions for how Analytic Work Spaces will be set up and distributed among analysts, working groups (ECTs, program area teams TBD, etc.), and country teams  
   3.	Long-term: Actively use Analytic Work Spaces once rolled out to larger user group, submit feedback/comments on improvements to PRIME, and work to identify visuals from Work Spaces to integrate into Panorama POART tool for all users.
   
3. Develop standards of practice for using Excel, other business intelligence software (including Tableau, Excel-BI, R-Shiny), statistical software (including Stata, R, SAS, SPSS) and spatial analytic software (including ArcGIS and QGIS) in integration, visualization, and dissemination of routinely collected PEPFAR data. This may include software testing for software integration as needed.
   1.	Create and provide trainings on utilizing recommended practices as well as software to perform analyses on PEPFAR data.    
   2.	Develop style guides for use by analysts to promote cohesion of work at ICPI
   
4. Review all current excel based ICPI tools and set standardized, harmonized, clear and concise recommendations for visuals, tables, and underlying data in Excel across multiple templates (i.e., design, graphics, axis, architecture of the tools) to improve the user experience and underlying efficiency of ICPI tools, Panorama and in-country analyses that ICPI supports
   1.	Create and circulate documents/excel templates to support tool owners with this harmonization  
   2.	Work with DAQ, workstream leads, and analysts to set recommendations around how to visualize age/sex disaggregations and completeness issues across tools
   
5. Work with tool owners to document common data needs, including calculated indicators and other analytic requests for MER, EA, and SIMS, and identify correct group to update datasets and data systems where applicable 
PRIME/ICPI Bridge Meeting: Bi-weekly DAQ meetings, weekly DAQ/PRIME meetings
   1. Receive requests from work stream leads, identify similarities across work streams and clearly document new requirements  
   2. Communicate directly with the appropriate team on data requirement needs, including working with DAQ to bring these to DATIM, PDH team for integration into systems as needed or deemed applicable
  
6. Create a repository of visuals by key question, after reviewing existing analyses and visuals (e.g., from country team presentations, ICPI tools, partner tools etc.). 
   1. Maintain catalogue of existing visuals, tagged for common requested elements, to share with country teams to show ICPI’s capabilities as potential starting points for in-country dashboards  
   2. The repository may also be used to identify best practices for tool-building and any programmatic gaps, focusing both on MER tools as well as cross-cutting best practices in coordination with SIMS, EA, and other workstreams.


### Proposed DIV Structure and Products

Group Structure: Proposal to break into three sub-groups as follows:

-	**Business Intelligence System Coordination**: This sub-group will drive activities (1) and (2), focusing on transitioning existing visualizations into Panorama and driving Analytic Work Space activities, including innovation management and new visuals in the work spaces. This team will work with technical teams to set requirements around visualizations and back-end data needs.
Proposed products/outputs: Data visualizations in Panorama, quarterly request documents, documented analytic work space recommendations 
-	**Guidance & Capacity Building**: This sub-group will drive activities (3) and (4), focusing on making visualizations easier for staff by identifying the best practices for analytics, training staff on how to perform and stand up analyses or create visualization, and working to create  style guides to assist with data analysis and visualization. This group will also hold regular webinars to cross-train analysts in ICPI tools.
Proposed products/outputs: Expand on “Choosing the right software for the task” presentation to the Uganda/Kenya TDY team to create a “Right software for the task” deck, trainings presented to ICPI and other staff on analytic best practices, style guides for analysts. Additionally, webinars periodically to review existing tools with analysts to make sure all are informed of current analyses
-	**Visualization Library & Stakeholder Engagement**: This sub-group will drive activity (6), including identifying existing ICPI and field visualizations and coordinating with field users and other stakeholders external to ICPI to understand  how visualizations were created (what were the key questions, data sources, and processes for creation). This group will also be responsible for coordinating analytic requests from external stakeholders that may benefit from using multiple existing visualizations. 
Proposed products/outputs: Documented catalogue of active ICPI and known field visualizations, including indications on datasets used, attributes included, and other identifying information for the visualization. Additionally, creating workplans for engagement with external stakeholders as needs arise.
- Cross-cutting activity: Activity (5) may be performed by all three sub-groups as data needs are identified. Recommendation to have one individual in the group serve as the point of contact for working with DAQ and PRIME to coordinate data needs and updates. 
Proposed outputs include calculated indicator request forms and other formal data analysis request documents


### DIV Meetings and Staffing Proposal
- Meetings:
  -	Full group: Every two weeks
  - Small co-leads and sub-group leads group: Alternate weeks, with attendance also expected at full group meetings
- Members:  Designated by Agency Leads—proposal below
