Data Integration and Visualization (DIV) Objective: The DIV Team supports ICPI and PEPFAR through promoting innovative analyses and visualizations. DIV is responsible for coordinating and developing best practices for data integration and visualization through two main sub-groups/pillars: 1) Business Intelligence, and 2) Guidance and Capacity Building. Brittney Shook (DOD Agency Lead) serves as a representative from ICPI Leadership, providing additional insight from across the clusters.

The DIV advances ICPI&#39;s objectives in Innovation, Capacity Building, and Efficiencies.

The DIV Team functions within the Coordination Cluster, coordinating projects with the DAQ, OCM, ICEE, and ECT Liaisons where appropriate. The below diagram identifies the DIV&#39;s placement within the ICPI Organizational Structure and its sub groups.

## Coordination within ICPI (All Sub-Groups)

To improve efficiencies of workflows and analysis within the ICPI pertaining to data, analysis, and visualization, the DIV coordinates with and across the following groups and points:

1. Facilitate improved coordination within ICPI by integrating representatives from the DAQ and PRIME into the DIV&#39;s sub-groups.
2. Promote greater coordination around data, analysis, and visualization between the DAQ and PRIME by participating in Bi-weekly DAQ meetings, and weekly DAQ/PRIME/DATIM meetings.
3. Coordinate activities with the ICEE team around ICPI capacity building.
4. Transmit DIV products (e.g. Outcomes includes draft/completed projects, products, trainings, etc.) to OCM in a timely manner to aid in their prompt review and/or dissemination.
5. Establish POCs for analytic clusters to liaise with DIV and keep abreast of relevant BI requests

Specific collaboration with DAQ:
- ICPI training on data management and processing best practices (using open source platforms) to be done in collaboration with DAQ (e.g., R training)
- Develop methods &amp; best practices for structuring external data sources in order to facilitate aligning disjointed data sources in Panorama&#39;s Analytic Workspaces
- Explore innovative data management, processing and visualization methods using open source platforms including R-Shiny, Tableau

## Business Intelligence System Coordination (Leads: Jess Brown, Katie O&#39;Connor)

**BI Objective:** Transition existing visualizations into Panorama and driving Analytic Work Space activities, including innovation management and new visuals in the work spaces.This team will work with technical teams to set requirements around visualizations and back-end data needs.

**Main projects and activities:**

1. Continue to translate routine tools in to existing PEPFAR BI tool (i.e., Panorama)

1. Communicate directly with PRIME on visuals for Panorama: PRIME/ICPI Bridge Meeting: quarterly priority-setting meetings
2. Prioritize and rank tools and visuals for integration
3. Set requirements for tools to be integrated

1.  Continue to work on and expand the role of the analytic workspaces in Microstrategy, and support the development of analytic workspaces

1. Short-term: Lead Phase II of Analytic Work Spaces (through end of August)
2. Medium-term: Provide feedback into discussions for how Analytic Work Spaces will be set up and distributed among ICPI analysts
3. Long-term: Actively use Analytic Work Spaces once rolled out to larger user group, submit feedback/comments on improvements to PRIME, and work to identify visuals from Work Spaces to integrate into Panorama POART tool for all users.

## Guidance &amp; Capacity Building (Leads: Aaron Chafetz, Katya Noykhovich)

**GCB Objective:** Improve workflow, analysis, and visualizations produced by ICPI staff, headquarters and the field by identifying the best practices, training staff on developing better analyses and visualizations, and creating guides to assist with data analysis and visualization.

**Main projects and activities:**

1. Develop standards of practice for documentation, analysis and visualization using collaborative/version control tools (e.g. git/GitHub), business intelligence software (e.g.  Tableau, R-Shiny), statistical software (e.g. Excel, Stata, R, SAS, SPSS) and spatial analytic software (e.g. ArcGIS, QGIS).
2. Develop and facilitate trainings on utilizing recommended practices as well as software to perform analyses and create visualization using PEPFAR data.
3. Develop guides for use by analysts to promote cohesion of ICPI activities and deliverables.
